# Frontend Chat Application Documentation

## Overview
This is the frontend part of the Deepseek Chat Application, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to engage in real-time chat using the Deepseek API for backend processing.

## Project Structure
The frontend consists of the following files:
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the chat application.
- `js/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that manages user interactions and communicates with the backend.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepseek-chat-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd deepseek-chat-app/frontend
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the chat application.

## Usage
- The chat interface allows users to send and receive messages.
- Messages are processed through the backend Flask application, which interacts with the Deepseek API.

## Development
- To modify styles, edit the `css/styles.css` file.
- To add or change functionality, update the `js/app.js` file.
